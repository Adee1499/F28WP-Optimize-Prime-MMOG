camelCase naming - e.g. likeThis

Lower case variables. Upper case functions. - e.g. int thisIsAVariable; int ThisIsAFunction();


### Project maintenance conventions:

Folders:
Full lowercase for project directories with full upercase for abbreviations and underscores to seperate words. - e.g. UI_files; HTML_pages; CSS; images;

Files:
camelCase with a starting lower case for file names. - e.g. homePage.html; style.css; canvas.js; playerModel.jpg; README still in caps because it's special <3
